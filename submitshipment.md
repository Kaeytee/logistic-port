# Submit Shipment Feature Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation and enhancements made to the Submit Shipment feature in TransGlobalFreight's Next.js app. The feature provides a multi-step form interface for creating new shipment requests with comprehensive data collection and validation. The form collects sender information, recipient details, package specifications, and presents a summary for confirmation before submission.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the shipment submission process:

- Lacked responsive design for mobile users
- Had no visual feedback for multi-step progression
- Did not effectively organize form data for final review
- Had several syntax errors and interface inconsistencies
- Included hard-coded values rather than centralized constants

## Key Changes & Components

### 1. StepIndicator Component

- **Purpose:** Provides visual feedback on multi-step form progress.
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Adapts to different screen sizes with appropriately sized elements.
  - Uses smaller elements on mobile and larger on desktop.
- **Visual Enhancements:**
  - Shows checkmark icon on the final step for completion feedback.
  - Uses red highlight (`#FF0000`) for the progress line before the current step.
  - Colors all completed steps for better visual tracking.

### 2. SubmitShipmentPage Form

- **Purpose:** Multi-step form for submitting new shipment requests.
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Container adapts to screen size with different padding and widths:
    ```tsx
    <div className="w-full md:w-[90%] lg:w-[85%] mx-auto px-4 sm:px-8 md:px-12 lg:px-20 ...">
    ```
  - Optimized layout for mobile and desktop viewing.
- **Form Steps:** - Step 1: Sender information collection
  - Step 2: Recipient information collection
  - Step 3: Package details collection
  - Step 4: Review and confirm submission
- **Form Validation:**

  - Comprehensive validation for all required fields:

    ```tsx
    const validateForm = () => {
      // Required fields validation
      const requiredFields = {
        // Sender information
        senderName: "Sender Name",
        senderAddress: "Sender Address",
        // ...additional fields

        // Conditionally required fields based on ID usage
        ...(formData.recipientKnowsId
          ? { recipientId: "Recipient ID" }
          : {
              recipientName: "Recipient Name",
              recipientEmail: "Recipient Email",
              // ...additional fields
            }),
      };

      const missingFields: string[] = [];
      for (const [field, label] of Object.entries(requiredFields)) {
        if (!(formData as any)[field]) {
          missingFields.push(label);
        }
      }

      if (missingFields.length > 0) {
        alert(
          `Please fill in the following required fields:\n${missingFields.join(
            "\n"
          )}`
        );
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    };
    ```

  - User-friendly error notifications
  - Conditional validation based on selected options

### 3. ConfirmForm Component

- **Purpose:** Final step in the shipment submission process that summarizes all previous inputs.
- **Features:**
  - Organizes information into clear sections: Sender, Recipient, and Package.
  - Uses the tetiary color (`#1A2B6D`) for section headings for consistency:
    ```tsx
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1A2B6D] border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 pb-2 mb-3">
      {title}
    </h3>
    ```
  - Shows different data depending on whether recipient is identified by ID or contact details.
  - Formatted for improved readability with responsive layouts for different screen sizes:
    ```tsx
    <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row py-2 border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 last:border-b-0">
      <div className="font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 w-full sm:w-1/3 mb-1 sm:mb-0">
        {label}:
      </div>
      <div className="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200 w-full sm:w-2/3">
        {value === true ? "Yes" : value === false ? "No" : value || "-"}
      </div>
    </div>
    ```
  - Clear final confirmation notice in highlighted blue box.
- **Implemented Improvements:**
  - Added helper functions to properly format different value types (boolean, strings, numbers)
  - Created lookup functions to display user-friendly labels for delivery and package types
  - Fixed syntax errors and properly typed component props
  - Implemented consistent error handling and fallback values
  - Added dark mode compatibility for all UI elements
  - Dynamically renders recipient information based on identification method (ID vs. contact details)
- **Code Example of Value Formatting:**

  ```tsx
  // Helper function to format values properly
  const formatValue = (value: any): string => {
    if (value === undefined || value === null || value === "") return "-";
    if (typeof value === "boolean") return value ? "Yes" : "No";
    return String(value);
  };

  // Get delivery type label from its id
  const getDeliveryTypeLabel = (id: string): string => {
    const deliveryType = DELIVERY_TYPES.find((type) => type.id === id);
    return deliveryType ? deliveryType.label : id || "-";
  };
  ```

### 4. Custom useShipmentForm Hook

- **Purpose:** Centralizes form state management and input handling logic.
- **Implementation:**
  - Created a reusable custom hook to manage form state across all steps
  - Provides consistent handlers for various input types (text fields, checkboxes, selects)
  - Implements special logic for conditional field relationships
  - Includes form reset functionality for cancellations or submissions
- **Code Example:**

  ```tsx
  export function useShipmentForm<T>(initialFormData: T) {
    const [formData, setFormData] = useState(initialFormData);

    // Handler for form input changes
    const handleInputChange = useCallback(
      (
        e: React.ChangeEvent<
          HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement | HTMLSelectElement
        >
      ) => {
        const { name, value, type } = e.target;
        const checked = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).checked;

        setFormData((prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          [name]: type === "checkbox" ? checked : value,
          // Reset recipient name if ID is being used and changes, or if switching modes
          ...(name === "recipientKnowsId" && {
            recipientName: "",
            recipientId: "",
          }),
        }));
      },
      []
    );

    // Reset form to initial state
    const resetForm = useCallback(() => {
      setFormData(initialFormData);
    }, [initialFormData]);

    return { formData, setFormData, handleInputChange, resetForm };
  }
  ```

### 5. Constants Organization

- **Purpose:** Improved code maintainability and reusability through centralized constants.
- **Implementation:**
  - Added `DELIVERY_TYPES` and `PACKAGE_TYPES` to constants.ts for application-wide access.
  - Standardized data structures for form options to ensure consistency.
  - Made constants accessible across the entire application

## Summary of Work
